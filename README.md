## Installation

1. Create a `pipenv`-managed virtual environment and install the latest version: `pipenv install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/emojiguessr`. (Note that if you've previously created a `pipenv` virtual environment in the same directory, you may have to delete the old one first. Find out where it is located with the `pipenv --venv` command.)
2. Activate the virtual environment: `pipenv shell`.
3. Create a Python program file that imports the package and uses it, e.g. `from emojiguessr import quiz` and then ` print(quiz.make_quiz_item())`.
4. Run the program: `python3 my_program_filename.py`.
5. Exit the virtual environment: `exit`.

Try running the package directly:

1. Create and activate up the `pipenv` virtual environment as before.
2. Run the package directly from the command line: `python3 -m emojiguessr`. This should run the code in the `__main__.py` file.
3. Exit the virtual environment.
