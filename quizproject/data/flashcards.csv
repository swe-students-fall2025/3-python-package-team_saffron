1,"In Python, everything is an object - even numbers and functions!"
2,"Indentation defines structure in Python - forget braces, spacing matters."
3,Variables don't need types declared - Python figures them out automatically.

36,Booleans in Python are capitalized - True and False.

52,Dict comprehensions let you create mappings in one neat line.
53,Generators use yield to return items lazily - one by one.
54,Iterators remember where they left off - that's why you can only loop once.
